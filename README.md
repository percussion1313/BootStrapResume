Bootstrap Resume
In this lab, the goal is to recreated the resume that is found in the attached PDF.

Hints
Remember that you need a container, row and column and you can have multiple containers on the page at once. You could put the header in one container, and the skills in another. It's up to you, but think about it logically.
You might want to checkout these components: Alerts, List Groups, Cards, and Jumbotron
